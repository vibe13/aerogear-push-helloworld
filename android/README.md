Technologies: Java, Android  
Summary: A basic example of Push : Registration and receiving messages.  
Target Product: JBoss Mobile Add-On  
Product Versions: 1.0.0  
Source: https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-push-helloworld/android   

## What is it?
The ```helloworld``` project demonstrates how to include basic push functionality in Android applications.

This simple project consists of a ready-to-build Android application. Before building the application, you must register the Android variant of the application with a running AeroGear UnifiedPush Server instance and Google Cloud Messaging for Android. The resulting unique IDs and other parameters must then be inserted into the application source code. After this is complete, the application can be built and deployed to Android devices. 

When the application is deployed to an Android device, the push functionality enables the device to register with the running AeroGear UnifiedPush Server instance and receive push notifications.

## How do I run it?

###0. System Requirements
* [Java 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Maven 3.1.1](http://maven.apache.org) or later
* Latest [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and [Platform version 19](http://developer.android.com/tools/revisions/platforms.html)
* Latest [Android Support Library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html) and [Google Play Services](http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/index.html)

###1. Prepare Maven Libraries
This quickstart is designed to be built with Maven.

Google does not ship all the required libraries to Maven Central so you must deploy them locally with the helper utility [maven-android-sdk-deployer](https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer) as detailed here.

1. Checkout maven-android-sdk-deployer
```shell
$ git clone git://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer.git
```
2. Set up the environment variable ```ANDROID_HOME``` to contain the Android SDK path
3. Install Maven version of Android platform 19
```shell
$ cd /path/to/maven-android-sdk-deployer/platforms/android-19
$ mvn install -N
```
4. Install Maven version of google-play-services
```shell
$ cd /path/to/maven-android-sdk-deployer/extras/google-play-services
$ mvn install -N
```
5. Install Maven version of compatibility-v4
```shell
$ cd /path/to/maven-android-sdk-deployer/extras/compatibility-v4
$ mvn install -N
```
6. Install Maven version of compatibility-v7-appcompat
```shell
$ cd /path/to/maven-android-sdk-deployer/extras/compatibility-v7-appcompat
$ mvn install -N
```

###2. Register Application with Push Services
First, you must register the application with Google Cloud Messaging for Android and enable access to the Google Cloud Messaging for Android APIs and Google APIs. This ensures access to the APIs by the UnifiedPush Server when it routes push notification requests from the application to the GCM. Registering an application with GCM requires that you have a Google account.

1. Log into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
2. In the ```Projects``` view, click ```Create Project```.
3. In the ```PROJECT NAME``` field type a project name, select the check box to agree to the Terms of Service and click ```Create```.
4. Reload the page and in the ```Projects``` view click the project you just created. Make note of the ```Project Number```.
5. Click ```APIs and auth```>```APIs``` and change the status of ```Google Cloud Messaging for Android``` to ```ON```.
6. Click ```APIs and auth```>```Credentials``` and under ```Public API access``` click ```Create new Key```.
7. Click ```Server Key``` and click ```Create```. Make note of the ```API KEY```.

Second, you must register the application and an Android variant of the application with the UnifiedPush Server. This requires a running AeroGear UnifiedPush Server instance and uses the unique metadata assigned to the application by GCM. For information on installing the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server, see the README distributed with the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server or the [AeroGear documentation](http://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/ups_userguide/).

1. Log into the UnifiedPush Server console.
2. In the ```Applications``` view, click ```Create Application```.
3. In the ```Name``` and ```Description``` fields, type values for the application and click ```Create```.
4. When created, under the application click ```No variants```.
5. Click ```Add Variant```.
6. In the ```Name``` and ```Description``` fields, type values for the Android application variant.
7. Click ```Android``` and in the ```Google Cloud Messaging Key``` and ```Project Number``` fields type the values assigned to the project by GCM.
8. Click ```Add```.
9. When created, expand the variant name and make note of the ```Server URL```, ```Variant ID```, and ```Secret```.

###3. Customize and Build Application
The project source code must be customized with the unique metadata assigned to the application variant by the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server and GCM. 

1. Open ```/path/to/helloworld/android/src/org/jboss/aerogear/unifiedpush/helloworld/Constants.java``` for editing.
2. Enter the application variant values allocated by the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server and GCM for the following constants:
```java
String UNIFIED_PUSH_URL = "";
String VARIANT_ID = "";
String SECRET = "";
String GCM_SENDER_ID = "";
```
3. Save the file.
4. Build the application
```shell
$ cd /path/to/helloworld/android
$ mvn compile
```

###4. Test Application

####0. Prerequisites
The AeroGear UnifiedPush Server must be running before the application is deployed to ensure that the device successfully registers with the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server on application deployment.

####1. Deploy for testing
The application can be tested on physical Android devices only; push notifications are not available for Android emulators. To deploy, run and debug the application on an Android device attached to your system, on the command line enter the following:
```shell
$ cd /path/to/helloworld/android
$ mvn clean package android:deploy android:run
```

Application output is displayed in the command line window.

####2. Send a Push Message
You can send a push notification to your device using the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server console by completing the following steps:

1. Log into the UnifiedPush Server console.
2. Click ```Send Push```.
3. From the ```Applications``` list, select the application.
4. In the ```Messages``` field, type the text to be sent as the push notification.
5. Click ```Send Push Notification```.

## How does it work?

### Registration

```RegisterActivity``` is invoked right after a successful application login. The Activity life cycle ```onCreate``` is called first invoking the ```register``` method â€” attempting to register the application to receive push notifications.

```java
PushConfig config = new PushConfig(new URI(UNIFIED_PUSH_URL), GCM_SENDER_ID);
config.setVariantID(VARIANT_ID);
config.setSecret(SECRET);

Registrations registrations = new Registrations();
PushRegistrar registrar = registrations.push("register", config);
registrar.register(getApplicationContext(), new Callback<Void>() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(Void data) {
        Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(),
                getApplicationContext().getString(R.string.registration_successful),
                Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Exception e) {
        Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), e.getMessage(), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        finish();
    }
});
```

### Receiving Notifications

Before the usage of GCM notifications on Android, we need to include some permissions for GCM and a broadcast receiver to handle push messages from the service.

To enable the permissions we add these as child of the manifest element.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
<uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE" />

<permission
    android:name="com.mypackage.C2D_MESSAGE"
    android:protectionLevel="signature" />

<uses-permission android:name="org.jboss.aerogear.unifiedpush.helloworld" />
```

And add this element as a child of the application element, to register the default AeroGear Android broadcast receiver. It will receive all messages and dispatch the message to registered handlers.

```xml
<receiver
    android:name="org.jboss.aerogear.android.unifiedpush.AeroGearGCMMessageReceiver"
    android:permission="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND" >
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE" />
        <category android:name="org.jboss.aerogear.unifiedpush.helloworld" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

All push messages are received by an instance of ```AeroGearGCMMessageReceiver```. They are processed and passed to Registrations via the ```notifyHandlers``` method.

The ```NotificationBarMessageHandler``` is able to receive that message and show it in the Notification Bar.

In the ```MessagesActivity``` we need to remove the handler when the Activity goes into the background and re-enable it when it comes into the foreground.

```java
@Override
protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    Registrations.registerMainThreadHandler(this);
    Registrations.unregisterBackgroundThreadHandler(NotificationBarMessageHandler.instance);
}

@Override
protected void onPause() {
    super.onPause();
    Registrations.unregisterMainThreadHandler(this);
    Registrations.registerBackgroundThreadHandler(NotificationBarMessageHandler.instance);
}
```
